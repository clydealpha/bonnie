# Execution Intelligence Engine for Polycassava

This document summarizes the main ideas of the comprehensive blueprint for the Execution Intelligence Engine (EI) that powers Polycassava's smart cassava plantation and manufacturing operations. The system leverages Google AI Gemini and the wider Google Cloud Platform to deliver autonomous, auditable decision making with full ESG compliance.

## Vision and Goals

- **Sovereign Execution Intelligence (SEI):** EI is designed to operate autonomously, executing decisions in real time while maintaining a deterministic and auditable trail. The system continually learns from historical data, embodying the "self-expanding" concept of SEI.
- **End-to-end Automation:** EI covers the entire lifecycle from cassava cultivation to manufacturing, acting as a single entry point for operations.
- **ESG Compliance:** ESG metrics are embedded into decision logic to ensure all actions adhere to environmental, social, and governance standards. Traceability is maintained through blockchain logging and detailed audit reports.
- **Alignment with Green Industry 5.0:** The architecture emphasizes resource efficiency and sustainable practices, leveraging advanced automation to reduce waste and optimize productivity.

## High-level Architecture

The solution adopts a serverless, microservices approach on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Key components are organized into the "Senses", "Brain", and "Hands" of the system:

- **Senses (Data Ingestion):**
  - **Cloud Pub/Sub** streams real-time data from IoT sensors, production systems, drones, and the blockchain ledger.
  - **Cloud Storage** stores raw files such as drone imagery and logs for later processing.
- **Brain (Execution Intelligence Engine):**
  - **BigQuery** acts as the data warehouse and "memory inheritance" for EI, storing historical data, ESG metrics, and audit logs.
  - **Vertex AI with Gemini** provides multimodal reasoning, decision making, and function calling capabilities.
  - **Cloud Workflows** orchestrates deterministic execution of tasks triggered by Gemini.
- **Hands (Action & Control):**
  - **Cloud Functions** or **Cloud Run** implement serverless microservices that perform real-world actions (e.g., irrigation control) and interact with external systems.
  - **Google Workspace APIs** are used for notifications and automated reporting.

Security and monitoring are integrated through Cloud IAM, Secret Manager, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and Security Command Center. Looker Studio dashboards present real-time metrics, ESG status, and carbon offset projections.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data ingestion**: IoT sensors relay soil moisture levels and drones supply multispectral imagery. Data is streamed via Pub/Sub and stored in BigQuery.
2. **Analysis**: Gemini analyzes the data, detects signs of water stress, and determines the optimal response.
3. **Execution**: Through function calling, Gemini activates Cloud Workflows, which in turn triggers Cloud Functions to adjust irrigation.
4. **Audit and notification**: Actions are recorded in BigQuery and optionally written to a blockchain ledger. Notifications are sent via Gmail, and dashboards update automatically.
5. **Continuous learning**: Gemini leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to use historical data in BigQuery, improving future decisions and supporting the self-expanding nature of SEI.

## Key Google Cloud Components

| Functionality | Recommended Services |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **EI Core** | Vertex AI (Gemini API), Cloud Workflows |
| **Data Ingestion** | Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud IoT Core, Cloud Storage |
| **Data Processing** | Dataflow / Dataproc |
| **Data Storage** | BigQuery, Cloud SQL/Spanner (optional) |
| **Action & Control** | Cloud Functions / Run, Google Workspace APIs |
| **Vision Analysis** | Vertex AI Vision / Cloud Vision API |
| **Dashboards** | Looker Studio / BigQuery BI Engine |
| **Security & Governance** | Cloud IAM, Secret Manager, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Security Command Center |

## Implementation Phases

1. **Proof of Concept (3–5 months):** Minimal GCP infrastructure with a small development team to validate architecture.
2. **Minimum Viable Product (6–12 months):** Expand features, increase team size, and integrate core services.
3. **Full Scale (12–24 months):** Complete automation, enhanced security, and continuous optimization with a larger team.

Human resources are the major cost factor across all phases. A multidisciplinary team—architects, AI/ML engineers, data engineers, backend and frontend developers, IoT specialists, DevOps, and ESG experts—is recommended.

## Next Steps for PoC

- **Create a new GCP project** and enable key APIs (Vertex AI, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Cloud Workflows).
- **Set up service accounts** with appropriate IAM roles.
- **Build initial data pipelines** to populate BigQuery tables such as `plantations_data` and `ei_decisions_audit`.
- **Prototype Gemini interactions** using Vertex AI SDK, including a simple function to simulate irrigation control.
